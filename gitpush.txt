//some useful profile settings:
//so you don't have to insert credentials all the time:

git config credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'

//this sets the reconcile setting for merges to fast forward. i've read that it is the recommended approach

git config --global  pull.ff true

//when first cloning the repo:

git remote add origin https://stea.iue.tuwien.ac.at/CppProjects2023/GroupNProject.git
git remote rename origin upstream

########################################

//use a new branch for every feature/issue. to create a branch do:

git checkout -b branch_name

//to commit (save) your work first do:

git add . //adds all edited files to the staging area

//then do this to commit your changes to your local copy of the repo:

git commit branch_name -m "message"

//then do this if it is the first ever push you are doing:

git push -u origin branch_name

//after that, this is enough:

git push  

########################################

//before doing anything with merge/push/pull/switch branches, always commit your changes, or revert them!


//to get branches from the remote use:
git pull
//and then this, to list all branches (also the ones on the remote):
git branch -a


//to merge the state of the remote into your local state, use:
git pull    //Only updates the current branch and merges automatically
git fetch   //Updates every branch, but doesn't "save" or merge anything into your files


//to revert any changes you made use the following when working with a local commit:
//first do:

git log

//and search for the commit you want to revert. then copy the hash (long alphanumeric string)
//after that do:

git revert [commit_hash]

//when reverting a merge, get the commit hash (yes merge commits and commit commits have the same name...) and then:

git revert -m 1 [commit_hash] // 1 indicates that you want to "keep" the changes of the merge parent 1. you'll have to read more into it to know what that means

//to delete a branch you dont need anymore

git branch -D branch_name
